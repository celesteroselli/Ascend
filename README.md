Ascend 2024 - Design a tool to assist in long-duration space travel for astronauts.

<h2>GalaxSee</h2>
Galaxsee is a tool to help astronauts connect with their friends, family, and any loved ones back on Earth. It provides astronauts with an asynchronous video messaging system, as well as a rotating photo gallery for pictures and updates from Earth. Astronauts can send face-to-face messages to their loved ones, strengthening their connection even from far away. They can also customize the interface with their favorite pictures and locations from Earth to personalize their experience.

<h2>Design and Development</h2>
The backend of this site (message storing, authentication systems, and overall functionality) is powered by Python, specifically the Django framework. The front-end was designed on Figma and Canva, and coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We developed this app for the Ascend 2024 hackathon, so we completed the entire project in just over 24 hours!
